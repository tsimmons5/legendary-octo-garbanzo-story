	One day after the first snowfall of the year Madison, Wisconsin, Will looks up to the top of the dreaded Bascom Hill. Will is in his first year and although he has made the climb up Bascom (somewhat successfully) many times, today he feels a new sense of fear as he anticipates his journey to his last class at the top of the hill. He had managed to barely escape falling on the quickly formed ice when leaving his apartment this morning, and he hoped he would have the same luck with Bascom. As he looks at the steep incline of the hill, Will thinks back to all the times he fell down the icy hill during his freshman year
and how he swore to never have class on Bascom again. Unfortunately, he was unable to avoid this as his lecture was only held in Bascom Hall. He takes a deep breath, tightens his backpack straps, and prepares for the seemingly endless hike.
