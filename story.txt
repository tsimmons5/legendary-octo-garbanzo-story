	One day after the first snowfall of the year Madison, Wisconsin, Will looks up to the top of the dreaded Bascom Hill. Will is in his first year and although he has made the climb up Bascom (somewhat successfully) many times, today he feels a new sense of fear as he anticipates his journey to his last class at the top of the hill. He had managed to barely escape falling on the quickly formed ice when leaving his apartment this morning, and he hoped he would have the same luck with Bascom. As he looks at the steep incline of the hill, Will thinks back to all the times he fell down the icy hill during his freshman year
and how he swore to never have class on Bascom again. Unfortunately, he was unable to avoid this as his lecture was only held in Bascom Hall. He takes a deep breath, tightens his backpack straps, and prepares for the seemingly endless hike. 

After a minute of climbing he realized that he had only made it a few feet, the ground was slippery as ever and he figured hed have to be more creative
Will pulled out his expandable snowboard from his backpack, and attached it to the largest man he could find. "Mush!" he screamed at the top of his lungs. The man quickly started to run towards the top of the hill.
As they reach the top of Bascom, Will disconnects, and his momentum sends him careening through a window!  He picks himself up, glass and snow all around him, he finds that he is in a full classroom and all eyes are on him.

Will looks around with a red face, noticing the judgemental looks everyone is giving him. He avoids their gaze as he quickly looks down at his watch to see if he was too late. He gives a sigh of relief as he sees the time on his wrist, 2:30. He adjusts his  backpack and sits down in the nearest seat, ignoring the shattered glass around him. He had made it to class on time and Deb had justt finished setting up the livestream. He takes out this notebook and with a smile on his face he writes, "Week 06: Hashtables".

The End.
